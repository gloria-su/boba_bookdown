This project is co-authored by two M.S. in Analytics students at North Carolina State University, Violet Evans and Gloria Su. The inspiration behind our side project came from our love for bubble tea, a staple of Asian American culture. Bubble tea, also known as boba, is a sweet Taiwanese drink that has grown in popularity across the world since 1988 (Wei, 2023). Much of this growing popularity started from a new generation of young Asian Americans, who spread the drink to friends and neighbors from all different cultural backgrounds (Zhang, 2019). As Asian Americans raised in North Carolina, we frequently longed for authentic Asian cuisines in the Triangle that would reconnect us with our heritage. Growing up, boba culture wasn’t large. However, the popularity of boba in the broader Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area (the Triangle) has surged, coinciding with the arrival of nearly 40,000 households and businesses between 2018 and 2022. This growth has brought a number of trendy Asian boba shops to the Triangle region. Not only has the number of shops increased, but there also has been a rise in the count of Yelp reviews for each individual shop. Due to the extensive variety of boba shop offerings, spanning from milk tea to fruit tea, there has never been widely recognized standards for defining a good drink. Our project goal is to examine the criteria for a successful boba shop by utilizing the Fusion API to analyze ratings and reviews from the Yelp business directory. The inspiration behind our Yelp API project came from a day in the library after studying for our statistical foundations class. We were chatting about our favorite boba drinks, and the conversation led to our own debate over what truly was the best boba shop in the area. One idea led to another and we began delving into what a statistical side project could look like on a topic we were invested in— and thus began “An Analysis of Boba Yelp Reviews.” "],["data.html", "2 Data 2.1 Data Extraction 2.2 Data Manipulation 2.3 Data Exploration", " 2 Data Utilizing Python and the Pandas library, we initiated the web scraping process to compile our final data set in CSV format. 2.1 Data Extraction Our data extraction process began with leveraging the Yelp Fusion API, a tool that provides access to Yelp’s extensive global business directory. To initiate this process, we submitted a developer application for a private API key through the Yelp Fusion website. Fortunately, the acquisition of the API key and the method to define the appropriate endpoint for our queries were fairly straightforward. More specifically, we used the ‘businesses search’ endpoint to search the Yelp database and retrieve information about businesses, including location, category, and keywords. However, our interaction with the Yelp Fusion API was not without limitations. Notably, businesses lacking any Yelp reviews would not be returned by the API, leading to the exclusion of new boba shops. Furthermore, the API imposed restrictions, limiting us to 500 API calls per day and three reviews per business. To optimize the efficiency of data retrieval from the API, we implemented a Yelp API wrapper obtained from the GitHub repository authored by @gfairchild. The Yelp API wrapper functioned as an intermediary layer, simplifying the communication process between our system and Yelp’s data services. By leveraging the wrapper, we were able to enhance the clarity of our code and simplify the technical intricacies associated with making requests directly to the API. Having secured access to the Yelp Fusion API, we moved on to defining the variables for our analysis. Despite Yelp offering a diverse array of information, we encountered instances where certain data fields, such as price or wifi, contained many null values. We chose to move forward by discarding variables where the number of null values exceeded 50% of the total number of values and omitted the “price” and “wifi” features provided from Yelp. We moved forward in our analysis with the features listed below. ## [1] &quot;Name&quot; &quot;Phone&quot; ## [3] &quot;Rating&quot; &quot;Address&quot; ## [5] &quot;Street.Address&quot; &quot;City&quot; ## [7] &quot;Categories&quot; &quot;Review.Count&quot; ## [9] &quot;Latitude&quot; &quot;Longitude&quot; ## [11] &quot;Reviews&quot; &quot;source&quot; ## [13] &quot;Authenticity&quot; &quot;Restaurant&quot; ## [15] &quot;chain&quot; &quot;Bubble.Tea_ind&quot; ## [17] &quot;Coffee...Tea_ind&quot; &quot;Juice.Bars...Smoothies_ind&quot; ## [19] &quot;Taiwanese_ind&quot; &quot;Tea.Rooms_ind&quot; ## [21] &quot;Desserts_ind&quot; &quot;Ice.Cream...Frozen.Yogurt_ind&quot; ## [23] &quot;Shaved.Ice_ind&quot; &quot;Donuts_ind&quot; ## [25] &quot;Asian.Fusion_ind&quot; &quot;Vietnamese_ind&quot; ## [27] &quot;Cafes_ind&quot; &quot;Bakeries_ind&quot; ## [29] &quot;Ramen_ind&quot; &quot;Arcades_ind&quot; ## [31] &quot;Chicken.Wings_ind&quot; &quot;Sandwiches_ind&quot; ## [33] &quot;Japanese_ind&quot; &quot;Waffles_ind&quot; ## [35] &quot;Sushi.Bars_ind&quot; &quot;Custom.Cakes_ind&quot; ## [37] &quot;Dim.Sum_ind&quot; &quot;Hong.Kong.Style.Cafe_ind&quot; ## [39] &quot;Creperies_ind&quot; &quot;Chinese_ind&quot; ## [41] &quot;International.Grocery_ind&quot; Each shop, which is also each Yelp entry, is designated with up to three tags. These include phrases like “bubble tea” or “coffee shop”. We filtered on the tag “bubble tea” to finish designating our data sets for both Raleigh and New York City (NYC). The source variable attaches each shop to a location. 2.2 Data Manipulation Before proceeding with the modeling phase, we conducted further data manipulation. Specifically, we employed string splitting on the tags to create binary indicator variables for each of the shop’s categories. A shop could have three categories at maximum. For instance, a binary indicator variable for bubble tea was set to 1 if the observation fell under the bubble tea category and set to 0 otherwise. This approach allowed us to capture nuanced insights for a more comprehensive analysis of boba shops in the Raleigh and NYC areas. This concluded the iterative process to achieve a final data set. Below are the first three observations of the final data set. ## Name Phone Rating Address ## 1 OMTea Boba &amp; Bites 19198098493 4.5 3901 Capital Blvd, Raleigh, NC 27604 ## 2 Moge Tee - Raleigh 19842009008 4.5 2304 Hillsborough St, #100, Raleigh, NC 27607 ## 3 Cha House - Raleigh 19195941980 4.5 3001 Hillsborough St, Ste 108, Raleigh, NC 27607 ## Street.Address City Categories Review.Count ## 1 3901 Capital Blvd Raleigh Bubble Tea, Coffee &amp; Tea, Juice Bars &amp; Smoothies 57 ## 2 2304 Hillsborough St Raleigh Bubble Tea 90 ## 3 3001 Hillsborough St Raleigh Bubble Tea, Taiwanese, Coffee &amp; Tea 86 ## Latitude Longitude ## 1 35.83500 -78.58510 ## 2 35.78758 -78.66618 ## 3 35.78926 -78.67615 ## Reviews ## 1 [&quot;My mom loves boba and has been trying to make me love for it for years.

This work can be found in the R folder of the Xiaolongbao respository under the week 11 RMD. Raleigh had n= 43 observations while NYC had n= 70 observations, each with different column counts due to the category tag columns. Raleigh had 28 columns, while NYC had 31 columns. The following variables formed the core of our analysis: Name Rating City Categories Review Count Source Additional variables like chain, authenticity, and restaurant were imputed by using external sources such as Google and our own expertise. 2.3 Data Exploration Prior to analysis, we performed some exploratory data analysis in RStudio. Yelp’s ratings and reviews work by allowing users to rate businesses on a scale of one to five and write a review about their experiences (Yelp Reviews in 2023: Complete Guide, 2023). One of the most thought-provoking visualizations we crafted was a boxplot comparing the distribution of ratings of boba shops in Raleigh and NYC, pictured below in Figure 1. Contrary to our initial expectations, the boxplot revealed that Raleigh-based boba shops exhibited higher ratings compared to their counterparts in NYC by 0.35 stars on average. We expected NYC to have higher ratings since it is known as a “haven for Chinese cuisine,” including boba (Tran, 2021). While at first glance it seemed like there was a difference in mean ratings between the two locations, we sought a more quantitative approach. Therefore, we conducted a statistical test to assess the significance of the observed variations in ratings between Raleigh and NYC, highlighted in section 3. "],["methodology-and-results.html", "3 Methodology and Results 3.1 Statistical Tests 3.2 Linear Regression Model 3.3 Random Forest Model 3.4 Visualization", " 3 Methodology and Results 3.1 Statistical Tests Prior to conducting any statistical tests, we checked the assumptions for normality, equal variance, and independence. Since we had a relatively small data set, we used the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess whether the shops were normally distributed and Levene’s test for equality of variances (F-test) between shops in Raleigh and NYC. While the normality assumption did not hold (p= 3.81 x 10-4), we were able to confirm the equality of variances (p= 0.81). For the independence assumption, we assumed each shop was independent; however, we created a feature called “chain” that provided a binary flag if there were multiple locations. Thus, we performed a Wilcoxon’s 2 sample t-test on the two different groups. We found that boba shops in Raleigh were significantly different from boba shops in NYC, with a p-value of 4e-03. All statistical tests utilized a significance level (alpha) of 0.05. The mean rating of shops in Raleigh was 4.16 (variance 0.32), while the mean rating in NYC was 3.84 (variance 0.35). This resulted in a difference in means of 0.35. With our intial hypothesis confirmed by the statistically significant difference, our focus shifted to a more detailed comparison of boba shops in Raleigh and NYC. We decided to utilize both an explanatory and predictive approach, running a linear regression model for explainability and a random forest model for predictability. 3.2 Linear Regression Model To utilize an explanatory approach, we built two different variable selection models with rating as the target variable using forward stepwise regression. One model was for Raleigh while the other model was for New York City. After setting a full model and an empty model separately for the Raleigh and NYC data sets, we ran stepwise selection with k, the number of model parameters, set to 2. The following code chunks display the stepwise selection code. 3.2.1 Raleigh Variable Selection ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Rating ~ Juice.Bars...Smoothies_ind + Asian.Fusion_ind + ## Coffee...Tea_ind + Bakeries_ind + Tea.Rooms_ind, data = raleigh_df) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.03755 -0.27358 0.06431 0.22642 0.72642 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The best linear regression for NYC had an AIC of -87.14 and found the features of authenticity, city, creperies, Taiwanese, and juice bar/smoothie indicator. Among the two sites, there were seven distinct features observed between the two variable selection models. The only shared feature was the juice bar/smoothie indicator, leading us to wonder if the random forest features would be similar. 3.3 Random Forest Model While random forest models are generally used for prediction, we used their ability to assess variable importance as a comparison point for the linear regression model. Our feature ranking was determined by the percent increase in the mean squared error (MSE). We assessed the variable importance of our predictive model output with a variable called “random”, seen in the plots below. The Raleigh plot of variable importance is displayed below: The top ten important variables for the predictive model in Raleigh were similar to the linear regression model. Of the three explanatory variables of the linear regression (juice bar/smoothie indicator, Asian fusion indicator, coffee/tea indicator), only juice bar/smoothie appeared before the random variable. A high overlap between explanatory and predictor variables allows us to infer that there are similar attributes that go into forming and retaining a good Raleigh boba shop. These include: Having a variety of options, such as smoothies and juices. Appealing to the “fusion” audience rather than as an authentic boba shop. Being tagged as a tea room. Having food options, such as baked goods. Offering coffee choices. The NYC plot of variable importance is displayed below: The top importance variables output from the random forest for New York City seemed to focus on location, seen in the ranking of the “city” feature. It’s important to note that the “city” variable was important in both the Raleigh and NYC variable importance outputs from our random forests; this may indicate that the shop’s location is a large factor in a Yelp rating. This output prompted us to visualize our dataset and explore the map of boba shops across both data sets. 3.4 Visualization We utilized the visualization platform Tableau to display both Raleigh and NYC boba shops by longitude and latitude. The feature “city” in the data set indicated that Raleigh’s n = 4 boba shops spanned 9 towns, while NYC’s n = 70 boba shops spanned 10 neighborhoods. We noticed that shops in NYC tended to be more concentrated or in closer proximity to each other than shops in Raleigh. This indicates that there was more competition in close proximity in NYC than in Raleigh. This visualization reiterated the results from both the variable selection model and the predictive random forest model. The variable selection model displayed the most significant explanatory variables, indicating a gap in features between locations. The random forest model confirmed that the “city” feature was important in mean boba shop rating outcomes, which could be attributed in part to physical shop proximity, as seen on the Tableau dashboard. "],["conclusion.html", "4 Conclusion 4.1 Final Thoughts 4.2 Recommendations", " 4 Conclusion 4.1 Final Thoughts The boxplot of mean ratings created questions around three main takeaways from our project: A significant difference in mean ratings between Raleigh, NC and NYC, NY. Determined important variables explaining why Raleigh boba shops are rated higher than NYC, using a linear regression model with stepwise selection and AIC metrics. The random forest model confirmed that the “city” feature was important in mean boba shop rating outcomes, which could be attributed in part to physical shop proximity, as seen on the Tableau dashboard. In Raleigh, Asian fusion and coffee/tea were important Yelp attributions to secure high ratings. Conversely, in NYC, authenticity and the Taiwanese attributions played key roles. These findings suggest that customers in NYC seem to have higher expectations as compared with customers in Raleigh, which was further supported after visual comparisons of each location data set. 4.2 Recommendations From our conclusion, we recommend that aspiring businesses considering a new boba shop could: Understand the preferences and expectations of potential customers. Prepare to face the competition in the area. Our findings emphasize that what garners a high rating in one location may not necessarily translate to the same acclaim in another, especially in densely populated areas like NYC. Looking ahead, this project encourages future comparative studies of bubble tea shops in different areas across the country or even the world. Expanding the analysis to include major metropolitan locations like Los Angeles or Taiwan could uncover broader trends in boba shop dynamics, providing entrepreneurs with valuable insights for navigating diverse urban landscapes.
