# Recommendations and Conclusion
## Conclusion
The boxplot created questions around two main takeaways from our project: 

 - The mean ratings across NYC and Raleigh.

 - Variable importance from the linear regression model and random forest model.

  - The linear regression model utilized stepwise selection to select significant explanatory variables with AIC metrics.

  - The random forest model confirmed that the cities feature was important in mean boba shop rating outcomes, which could be attributed in part to physical shop proximity, as seen on the Tableau dashboard.

In Raleigh, Asian fusion and bakeries were important factors to secure high ratings. Conversely, in NYC, authenticity and the offering of custom cakes played key roles. These findings suggest that customers in NYC seem to have higher expectations as compared with customers in Raleigh, which was further supported after visual comparisons of each location data set.

## Recommendations
From our conclusion, we recommend that aspiring businesses considering a new boba shop could:

 - Understand the preferences and expectations of potential customers.
 
 - Prepare to face the competition in the area.

Our findings emphasize that what garners a high rating in one location may not necessarily translate to the same acclaim in another location, especially in places like NYC.

Looking ahead, this project encourages future comparative studies of bubble tea shops in different areas across the country or even the world. Expanding the analysis to include major metropolitan locations like Los Angeles or Chicago could uncover broader trends in boba shop dynamics, providing entrepreneurs with valuable insights for navigating diverse urban landscapes.
