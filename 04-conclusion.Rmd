# Recommendations and Conclusion
## Conclusion:
The boxplot created questions around two main takeaways from our project: the mean ratings across locations and features to a linear explanatory model. 

The lack of overlap in regards to features between the Raleigh and NYC locations indicates that factors for highly rated boba shops vary by location. In Raleigh, Asian fusion and bakeries were important factors to secure high ratings. Conversely, in NYC, authenticity and the offering of custom cakes played key roles. These findings suggest that customers in NYC seem to have higher expectations as compared with customers in Raleigh, which was further supported after comparing the locations of the shops in each location against each other. 

## Recommendations:
From our conclusion, we recommend that aspiring businesses considering a new shop:

 - Understand the preferences and expectations of potential customers
 
 - Prepare to face the competition in the area

Our findings emphasize that what garners a high rating in one location may not necessarily translate to the same acclaim in another location, especially in places like NYC.

Looking ahead, this project encourages future comparative studies of bubble tea shops in different areas across the country or even the world. Expanding the analysis to include major metropolitan locations like Los Angeles or Chicago could uncover broader trends in boba shop dynamics, providing entrepreneurs with valuable insights for navigating diverse urban landscapes.
